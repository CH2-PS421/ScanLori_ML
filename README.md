<h1>ScanLori - Machine Learning</h1>
<p>This repository have both files and dataset for Image Classsification and Object Detection.</p>

<h2>Datasets</h2>
<p>For scalability purpose, the dataset consists of 37 classes for Image Classification and 8 for Object Detection.</p>
<p>Object detection used the help of RoboFlow API to annotate therefore there is no need for uploading the Dataset. The dataset is saved under the Roboflow(api_key) line</p>

<h2>Models</h2>
<p>Image Classification model was built from ground up using CNN model and Batch Normalization</p>
<p>Object Detection model was built using transfer learning with YoLoV8</p>
